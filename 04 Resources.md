# üóÇÔ∏è App Resources in Android and Compose

## üîπ What Are Resources?

**Resources** are all additional files and data used by the app outside of source code. Examples include: texts, colors, images, sizes. In Android, they are stored in the `res/` directory.

---

## üì¶ Types of Resources in Android

Android supports many types of resources you can use in your app:

- **Texts** (`res/values/strings.xml`) ‚Äì labels, messages, descriptions, error messages, button texts.
- **Colors** (`res/values/colors.xml`) ‚Äì color definitions used in the app.
- **Raster images** (`res/drawable/`) ‚Äì PNG, JPG, WebP files.
- **Vector images** (`res/drawable/`) ‚Äì XML VectorDrawable files.
- **App icons** (`res/mipmap/`) ‚Äì launcher icons in various resolutions.
- **Dimensions** (`res/values/dimens.xml`) ‚Äì margins, paddings, text sizes, widths, heights.
- **Styles** (`res/values/styles.xml`) ‚Äì view styles (fonts, colors, margins). *(Rarely used in Compose)*
- **Themes** (`res/values/themes/`) ‚Äì overall app themes (e.g., light/dark). *(Compose uses its own theming system)*
- **Arrays** (`res/values/arrays.xml`) ‚Äì lists of texts, colors, numbers.
- **Raw files** (`res/raw/`) ‚Äì any binary files, e.g., sounds, videos, text files.
- **Fonts** (`res/font/`) ‚Äì TTF/OTF font files.
- **Animations** (`res/anim/`, `res/animator/`) ‚Äì XML animations (transitions, movements). *(Not used in Compose, animations are done in code)*
- **Menus** (`res/menu/`) ‚Äì app menu definitions. *(Not used in Compose)*
- **Layouts** (`res/layout/`) ‚Äì XML view layouts (mainly in classic Android, rarely in Compose). *(Not used in Compose)*

> **Note:**  
> Resources marked in italics *(...)* are typical for classic Android (View System) and are not used or are marginally used in Jetpack Compose. In Compose UI, layouts, animations, and styles are defined directly in Kotlin code.

## üè∑Ô∏è Resource Identifier and `R` Class

Every resource in Android gets a **unique identifier** (ID), automatically generated during compilation and stored in the `R` class.

- The `R` class is generated by Android and contains nested classes for resource types, e.g., `R.string`, `R.drawable`, `R.color`, `R.dimen`.
- This lets you reference resources in code safely, e.g.:
  - `R.string.app_name`
  - `R.drawable.ic_launcher`
  - `R.color.primary`
  - `R.dimen.padding_large`

**Example in Compose:**
```kotlin
Text(text = stringResource(id = R.string.greeting))
Image(painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.avatar), contentDescription = null)
val color = colorResource(id = R.color.my_color)
val padding = dimensionResource(id = R.dimen.padding_large)
```
> **Info:**  
> You can also get resources using context:  
> ```kotlin
> val context = LocalContext.current
> val appName = context.getString(R.string.app_name)
> val drawable = ContextCompat.getDrawable(context, R.drawable.avatar)
> ```

**How does it work?**  
During compilation, Android assigns each resource a unique numeric ID and generates the `R` class, which allows easy and safe referencing of resources in code‚Äîno need to use file paths or names as strings.

## üìù Storing Text in Resources

All texts that appear in the app (titles, descriptions, messages, button texts) should be stored in `res/values/strings.xml`. This allows:

- easy support for multiple languages (internationalization),
- managing all texts in one place,
- changing text without modifying source code.

**Example `strings.xml`:**
```xml
<resources>
    <string name="app_name">My App</string>
    <string name="greeting">Welcome, user!</string>
    <string name="button_ok">OK</string>
    <string name="error_network">No internet connection</string>
</resources>
```

**In Compose:**
```kotlin
Text(text = stringResource(id = R.string.greeting))
```

## üñºÔ∏è Images: drawable vs mipmap

- **`drawable/`** ‚Äì place images used in the app here (illustrations, backgrounds, button icons). Supports raster (PNG, JPG) and vector (XML) graphics.
- **`mipmap/`** ‚Äì folder only for app icons. Android automatically selects the right version based on screen resolution.

**In Compose:**
```kotlin
Image(
    painter = painterResource(id = R.drawable.my_image),
    contentDescription = "Image description"
)
```
The app icon is set in the manifest file and should not be used in the app UI.

## üåç Alternative Resources

Android lets you create **alternative versions of resources** for different languages, resolutions, screen orientations, dark/light mode, and other device features. This way, the app can automatically adapt to the device and user preferences, without extra code to handle these variants.

**Examples of alternative directories:**
- `res/values-pl/strings.xml` ‚Äì Polish texts,
- `res/values-en/strings.xml` ‚Äì English texts,
- `res/drawable-hdpi/` ‚Äì images for high-res screens,
- `res/values-land/` ‚Äì resources for landscape mode,
- `res/values-night/` ‚Äì colors and styles for dark mode,
- `res/values-sw600dp/` ‚Äì resources for tablets and large screens.

**How does it work?**  
Android automatically selects the right resource based on system settings and device parameters (language, resolution, orientation, night mode, etc.).  
For example, if the user sets Polish, the system uses `strings.xml` from `values-pl`. If the device is in night mode, it loads colors from `values-night/colors.xml`.

**Advantages of alternative resources:**
- Make internationalization (multi-language) easier.
- Optimize appearance and behavior on different devices (phones, tablets, foldables).
- Enable dark mode support without extra code.
- Allow UI adaptation to screen orientation or size.

> **Tip:**  
> To create alternative resources, just add the appropriate folder in `res/` and put a file with the same name as in the base folder. Android will pick the right file at runtime.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips

- **Always use Compose functions to get resources** (`stringResource`, `colorResource`, `painterResource`, `dimensionResource`).
- **Avoid holding Context**
- **Store all texts in `strings.xml`** ‚Äì makes translation and content management easier.
- **Create alternative resources** for different languages and resolutions to make your app universal.
